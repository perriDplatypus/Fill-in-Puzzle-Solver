# Fill in Puzzle Solver
For this project, we have to design a fill-in puzzle solver. 
- A fill-in puzzle is like a crossword puzzle, except that instead of being given obscure clues telling us which words go where, you are given a list of all the words to place in the puzzle, but not told where they go. 
- A fillin puzzle will be represented as a list of lists, each of the same length and each representing a single row of the puzzle.
- Each element in each of these lists is either a: '#', denoting a solid, unfillable square; an underscore (_), representing a fillable square; or a single, lower case letter (e.g., h), denoting a pre-filled square. 

The output should be a solved puzzle.
